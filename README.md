# Parts of Speech Tagging

Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is a popular Natural Language Processing process which refers to categorizing words in a text (corpus) in correspondence with a particular part of speech, depending on the definition of the word and its context.

In this repository, I have shared implementation of a baseline and Hidden Markov Model POS Tagging model. Both of them are trained on the [CoNLL2000Chunking Dataset](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2000/chunking/). Find more about POS Tagging, and the code above, in the book "Speech and Language Processing (3rd Edition draft)" by Daniel Jurafsky and James H.Martin.
